# Todo - In an album

## Goals

Fullstack app for recordings tasks.
Completed in less than the length of two albums.
Albums: 
  - Infest The Rats' Nest by KGTLW. 9 songs, 34mins
  - Fishing For Fishies by KGTLW. 9 songs, 42mins

## Overview

Frontend written in React, using Redux. Think of state change as call to API for sake of speed.
Backend written with Nestjs, using a Posgres container. Bare-bones service/controllers.

Project template: https://github.com/Chandler-Davidson/web-app-template

## Caveats

Write code as fast as possible, clean up later.

If I pause the recording, its for logistical/family stuff :).
